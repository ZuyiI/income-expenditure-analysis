# income-expenditure-analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Filipino Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) data, as provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The FIES is a comprehensive nationwide survey conducted every three years, offering valuable insights into the economic well-being of Filipino households. This project delves into a subset of the FIES dataset, comprising over 40,000 observations and 60 variables, to uncover trends and relationships between socio-demographic characteristics and household financial patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset includes variables detailing household income sources, expenditure items, consumption levels, and related socio-demographic information.

## Business Questions Explored

* How do household income and expenditure relate with socio-demographic characteristics?
* What is the relationship between education level and household income?
* How do expenditure patterns differ based on the primary source of income?
* How does the employment status of the household head impact income and expenditure of the household?
* How does income and expenditure vary by household composition like single parent households vs dual parent households?

## Summary of Findings

* **Education Level & Income**: There is a strong positive correlation between the household head's education level and total household income. Those with tertiary education (e.g., Law Programs, Post Baccalaureate) earn significantly more than those with elementary or no formal education.
* **Primary Income Source & Expenditure**: Households with "Wage/Salaries" as their primary income source generally have the highest total income and food expenditure. Households relying on "Other sources of Income" spend the most on housing and water, while those in "Entrepreneurial Activities" show lower food expenditure, possibly reflecting income inconsistency.
* **Employment Status & Finances**: Household heads "Working for government/government corporations" or "Working with pay in own family-operated farm or business" have the highest mean incomes and expenditures; which could highlight that formal employment provides greater financial stability and spending capacity compared to self-employment or work in private households.
* **Household Composition & Finances**: Dual-parent households and extended-family structures generally report higher income and expenditure. "Dual Parent, Extended Family" households show the highest mean income, while "Single Parent, Single Family" households have the lowest, which shows the economic benefits of shared resources and multiple income earners.
